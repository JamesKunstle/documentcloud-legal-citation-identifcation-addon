# DocumentCloud Add-On

This repository contains an example Add-On for DocumentCloud.  

Given an input list of documents or a query that specifies some list of 
documents, this add-on will scan through the provided documents and return 
a CSV of all of the identified legal citations in the text and to which document
of the input query / document list they belong.

Any documentation specifying how these citations are found and which citations
are valid is under the perview of the 'eyecite' python package and its maintainers.
